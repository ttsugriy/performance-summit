  - title: "Benchmarking in the Cloud - 50K transactions per second"
    presenter: Arun George John
    company:
    abstract: "Running massive product benchmarks in the Cloud can be challenging - It pushes the limits of application & platform performance, driving out unforeseen issues and the need for new solutions. This talk seeks to share insights from running one of the largest benchmarks in the banking product space, for a solution architected on a mix of technologies - AWS ECS, Microservices, Kinesis, Lambda, NuoDB, DynamoDB."

  - title: "Microservices: Single digit microseconds latency"
    presenter: Dmitry Pisklov
    company: Chronicle
    abstract: Optimizing code and infrastructure for ultra-low-latency microservices

  - title: "Optimising Computer Systems in Complex and Dynamic Parameter Space"
    presenter: Eiko Yoneki
    company: University of Cambridge
    abstract: "Performance tuning of computer systems is challenging for a variety of reasons. Modern computer systems expose many configuration parameters in a complex, massive parameter space. The systems are nonlinear and there is no method for quantifying or modelling such systems by performance tuning to the level of precision required. Furthermore, scheduling of tasks or resource allocation may require the control of dynamically evolving tasks. Auto-tuning has emerged using a black-box optimiser such as Bayesian Optimisation (BO). However, BO has limited scalability. Reinforcement Learning (RL) could be applied for combinatorial optimisation problems, but there is a gap between current research and practical RL deployments. I will introduce our framework to tackle these issues and demonstrate the potential of machine learning based methodologies for computer system optimisation."

  - title: "Optimising application performance by automating the data structure selection and tuning process"
    presenter: Michail Basios
    company: Turing Intelligence Technology Ltd.
    abstract: 'Data structure selection and tuning is laborious but can vastly improve an applicationâ€™s performance and memory footprint. Some data structures share a common interface and enjoy multiple implementations. We introduce Artemis, a multi-objective, cloud-based search-based optimisation framework that automatically finds optimal, tuned data structures and adapts the application to use them. Artemis can achieve substantial performance improvements for various applications and programming languages as we showed in our paper "Darwinian Data Structure Selection". 
In this talk, I will describe how we can tune the performance of applications (execution time, memory consumption, cpu usage) by automatically selecting and tuning their data structures. We will show how we can extract features from code bases and how to tackle them as an optimisation problem using Search based software engineering techniques. We will present a demo of our product (Artemis), and show how we have integrated it in the development pipeline. Last, we will discuss the lack of publicly available performance benchmarks and what can developers do to mitigate this problem.'
